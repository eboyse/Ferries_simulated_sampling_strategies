# Ferries_simulated_sampling_strategies

This repository provides code used for the study 'Sampling from commercial vessel routes can capture marine biodiversity distributions effectively' (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.23.497327v1). We downloaded data from online repositories GBIF and OBIS. We used data from online repositories to create a 'perfect knowledge' binary stacked species distribution model (SSDM). We then simulated different sampling strategies employing different sampling frames, number of sampling points and either regular or random sampling. We used these different sampling strategies to collect occurrence data from our perfect knowledge SSDM to remake SSDMs (sampling SSDMs). We compared the sampling SSDMs to the perfect knowledge SSDM using Pearson's correlation coefficient to evaluate how different sampling parameters (frame, number of sampling points, strategy) effected the predictive capacity of the sampling SSDMs.
